# unit-4-game

This is a game where you will be given a random number as a target for you to reach. 
-The target number is above the crystals.

Each crystal will have a number value that will add once you click the crystal. 
-You will not know the number value of the crystal til you click on the crystal.

If you reach the target number then you win the game and it will be logged to the right of the target number. The game will then start over and allow you to continue playing.

If you go over the target number then you lose the game and it will also be logged to the right of the target number. The game will also start over and allow you to try again.
